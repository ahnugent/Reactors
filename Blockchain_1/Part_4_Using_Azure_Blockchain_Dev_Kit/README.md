# Part 4. Using Azure Blockchain Development Kit

Microsoft produces tools to make developers' lives easier. Because of
their distributed and decentralized nature, it is tricky for
developers to get started and be productive. Microsoft's Azure
Blockchain Development Kit integrates with Visual Code and provides
tools and conveniences such as Solidity syntax highlighting to make
you more productive and successful with Blockchain solutions even if
you do not plan to deploy them to Azure Blockchain Services.
