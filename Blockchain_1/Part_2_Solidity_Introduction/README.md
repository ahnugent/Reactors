# Part 2. Solidity

Unlike Bitcoin which basically just transfers cryptocurrency from one
account to another, Ethereum has the ability to write Smart Contracts
that get deployed to and executed on the various nodes of the
platform. The main programming language for these contracts is called
Solidity although there are others that may be options in the future.

Complete the exercise to write and test a [SimpleStorage contract](Create_SimpleStorage_contract/README.md).
