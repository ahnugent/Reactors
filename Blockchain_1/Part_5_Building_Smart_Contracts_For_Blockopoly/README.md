# Part 5. Building Smart Contracts for Blockopoly

Our sample application is a fun variation on a famous boardgame. The
main idea maps really nicely to Blockchain systems and we are going to
build portions of the game as part of our exercises.

1. Start by completing the [Bank contract](Building_Blockopoly/BankContract/README.md).
2. Then move on to complete the [AssetManager contract](Building_Blockopoly/AssetManagerContract/README.md).
3. Finish up with the [Banker contract](Building_Blockopoly/BankerContract/README.md).
