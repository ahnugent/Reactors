# Instructions

### Goal
This directory contains the Bank contract from the previous exercise
and most of the AssetManager contract as well as a migration and a
test. You will need to fill in some details to make the tests pass.

### Steps
- First, run `npm install` to install dependencies.
  - If you don't have
  truffle or truffle-assertions installed globally, you will need to
  add them here as well (`npm install -g truffle` and `npm install -g
  truffle-assertions`).

- Second run, `truffle compile`. There shouldn't be any compilation errors.

- Run `truffle develop` and then run the `test` command. You should see
  one or more errors. To fix them, look for TODO indicators in the
  **contracts/AssetManager.sol** file. These will help you figure out what
  is required to make the tests pass.

- Solutions exists in [BankerContract](../BankerContract/) or in the [Completed_Solutions directory](../../../Completed_Solutions)

- When you are ready, move on to complete the [Banker contract](../BankerContract/README.md).
