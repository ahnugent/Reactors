# Introduction to Python for Data Science
Welcome to the Introduction to Python for Data Science Learning Path! The content in this learning path pairs with in person workshops that run in [Microsoft Reactors](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/) and are stand alone learning resources (you don't have to come to a workshop to benefit from these modules).

Throughout this Learning Path you will be encouraged to test out Python code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) using the Python extension and Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Setup your Environment
To learn most effectively throughout this Learning Path, we recommend that you setup your environment so that you can follow along. Follow these steps to setting up your environment:
1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is free and works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. 
2. Download and install the [Python extension for Visual Studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). This will include first installing a supported version of Python.
3. Activate the [Anaconda environment in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) to be able to run Jupyter notebooks.
4. Clone TBD

## Test your Environment
If you have successfully setup your environment with VS Code, Python, and Anaconda you should be able to run a Jupyter notebook inside of VS Code.

Open the cloned repo TBD

## Working through this Learning Path
As you're working through this Learning Path you will be encouraged to try out code. Use the files you cloned to do this.
