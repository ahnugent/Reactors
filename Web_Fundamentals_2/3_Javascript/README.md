# Part 3. JavaScript

JavaScript is the programming language of browsers. It's how you can incorporate interactivity into your pages, respond to user input, and communicate with the server. It's also one of the best programming languages to start with, since you can build many types of applications with JavaScript, and many of the programming constructs you'll learn are similar to other languages.
