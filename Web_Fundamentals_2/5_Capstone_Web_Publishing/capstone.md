# Activity: Pokemon & Pokedex

## Part 1

Using the PokeAPI, create a page that shows the first 151 Pokemon sprite images. You can build out 151 images by hand or you can use a for-loop in JavaScript and your jQuery knowledge to produce the image tags in the body of your HTML.  If the images load slowly, consider only loading 15 images.

``` html
    <!-- add http:// before the website name -->
    <img src="raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/1.png">
    <img src="raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/2.png">
    <img src="raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/3.png">
    <img src="raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/4.png">
```

Note: These images are hot-linked and may not work. Utilize the api v2 to find a sprite image that you can use to display the pokemon!

## Part 2

Add a click function to each of the Pokemon you rendered in the last PokeAPI assignment that will show the side panel pictured below.

![Pokedex Image](../images/ajax-pikachu.png)

How do you know which Pokemon was clicked? Maybe we can give each Pokemon a unique id that corresponds with their number in the URL?

``` html
<img id="2" src="raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/2.png">
<!-- add http:// before the website name -->
```

So that when the image is clicked, we get its id and add it to the end of this URL: `http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/` then we make the ajax request with that URL that we constructed.

Struggle with finding a solution for at least 30 minutes. Work with others in the workshop. If can't figure it out, then try implementing this code in your browser. Re-type it instead of just cutting and pasting so that you get familiar with every line. [Here is a working example.](https://codepen.io/dannyooooo/pen/229e50320ec54d6b8e2f845fa07672ba)
