# Activity: Dojo Diner

## Welcome to the CSS Dojo Diner

The goal of this activity is to get you familiar with how CSS works and so you can see what CSS can do.

To do this activity you must add the CSS code to select the elements that each panel asks you to select. There is also a help button you can reference if you need a hint to get the right CSS code in to select the element each level asks you to manipulate.
