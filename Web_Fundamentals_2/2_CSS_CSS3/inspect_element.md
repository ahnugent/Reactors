# Inspect Element

Editing HTML and CSS can feel like disarming a bomb; one little change and your project goes bananas. Your greatest ally in editing is a browser tool called **Developer Tools**. It is included in nearly all modern browsers that are available.

To access inspect element, simply right-click any element within the browser window and click **'Inspect'** and _voila!_ Inspect Element is a feature that displays all of the properties of the webpage you are currently viewing.

Each browser has it's own way of displaying the code a page is built with. You should check your browser's documentation, or ask your instructor about this now.

Here's the guide to the developer tools built into the [Edge browser.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide)
