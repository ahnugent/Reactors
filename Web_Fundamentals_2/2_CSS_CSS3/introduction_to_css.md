# What is CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that web developers use to present and define the style in a document (like a webpage) written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is one of the foundational blocks of the World Wide Web, along with Javascript and HTML.

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

CSS is used to define how content is presented, including layout, fonts, backgrounds, colors, and even transparency of a document.

## Getting started with CSS/CSS3

There are three ways of attaching CSS to a document:  inline, internal, and external. Inline and internal CSS are considered to be bad practices. We will only use external stylesheets, linked from the HTML document using the ```<head>``` tag. A stylesheet is a list of rules. Each rule (or "rule-set") consists of one or more selectors and a declaration block.

Refer back to the HTML section if you don't remember how to add a link to your ```<head>``` tag.

## Important point

> **CSS uses a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches a particular element. In this scheme, priorities (or "weights")  cascade and are assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.**
