# CSS Selectors

Selectors are used for declaring the HTML elements to which a style will apply.

## The most common selectors are

* all elements with a specific HTML tag (e.g., p, h1)
* elements specified by the following attributes:
  * id (these are preceded by # in CSS) These must be unique and can only be used once on your page.
  * class (these are preceded by .  in CSS) These can be used multiple times to share repeating CSS code.
Declaration Block
A declaration block is a list of declarations contained within braces. Each individual declaration consists of a property, a colon (":"), and a value. If a block has multiple declarations, they must be separated by a semi-colon(";").

## Here are some examples

For all "p" HTML tags, make the font color blue:

``` css
p{
  color: blue;
}
```

For an element with the id "important", make the font size 36px.

``` css
#important{
  font-size: 36px;
}
```

For all elements with the class "info", make the background green and add a 1px wide black border.

``` css
.info{
  background-color: green;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

In the above examples, ```p```, ```#important```, and ```.info``` are selectors. Color, font-size, background-color, and border are properties.

Now that we know a little more about how to use selectors, let’s make a general list of the internal priorities for CSS:

* element (1 point)
* .class (10 points)
* #id (100 points)

This is the default priority order. In addition to this, specificity will also count, for example,  ul li will override li. W3C has made a decent table over how you should calculate internal weight:

li            {...}  /* a=0 b=0 c=1 -> specificity =   1 */
ul li         {...}  /* a=0 b=0 c=2 -> specificity =   2 */
ul ol li      {...}  /* a=0 b=0 c=3 -> specificity =   3 */
li.red        {...}  /* a=0 b=1 c=1 -> specificity =  11 */
ul ol li.red  {...}  /* a=0 b=1 c=3 -> specificity =  13 */
 list         {...}  /* a=1 b=0 c=0 -> specificity = 100 */

a represents the number of #id attributes in the selector
b represents the number of class attributes
c represents the number of tag names

Combining these into a number will give you the actual weight. This means that  li #list will have the same weight as ul #list. This is probably one of the most confusing things about the cascade scheme, but it’s actually simpler than you might think: **it’s all about counting**.
