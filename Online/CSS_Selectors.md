# CSS Selectors
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) apply style, formatting, and layout to a page. Items to style are identified by a selector. 

## Common Selectors
The three common selectors are:
- Element
- Class name
- ID

You can find a [CodePen example on common selectors here](https://codepen.io/GeekTrainer/pen/OJVwXgL?editors=1100).

## Scoring
But what happens when multiple selectors try to apply to one element?

`Tag Name < Class Name < ID Else last write`

## Combinators
You can make style changes to elements based on the hierarchy of the HTML too, with combinators. This includes:  
`parent child` - All children  
`parent > child`- Only a direct child  
`sibling1 ~ sibling2` - Any sibling   
`sibling1 + sibling2`- Only an adjascent sibling

## Psuedo Classes
Style is applied to elements based on the state or location of the element. The style for this is:  
`element:psuedo-class`  

And some examples include:  
`a:visited` - style applied to links that have been visited by this person before  
`a:hover` - style applied to links that are hovered over

## Psuedo Elements
Style is applied to elements based on their content. The style for this is:  
`element::psuedo-element`  

And some examples include:  
`p::first-letter` - style applied to the first letter of any paragraph  
`p::selection` - style applied to text that is selected by the user

## Attribute Filters
Style is applied to elements based on the values. This style for this is:  
`element[attribute=value]`

And some examples inlude:  
`a[href$="pdf"]` - any link that ends in ".pdf"  
`a[href^="https"]` - any link that starts with "https"
