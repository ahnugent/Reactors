# Indentation Practice

Checkpoint:

- If you haven't installed [Visual Studio Code please install it now](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- [You can also perform this exercise here.](https://codepen.io/dannyooooo/pen/RwNyYXr)

Automatic code formatting is available in Visual Studio Code through the following shortcuts:

- On Windows: Shift + Alt + F
- On Mac: Shift + Option + F
- On Ubuntu: Ctrl + Shift + I

**Let's Start coding!**

Please fix this very ugly code!

Create a new file called ```indentation.html``` in Visual Studio Code and copy and paste the code below, from there you will beautify the code by adding proper identation:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>
Basic I
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
What language do you love?
</h1>
<p>
I love HTML!
</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Please note that most of the tags in the code below have not been discussed yet. But at this point, you already know what opening and closing tags look like. **Without knowing the HTML tags, determine what the parents, children, and siblings are by properly indenting the code below**:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            Basic II
    </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr><th>First Name</th><th>Last Name</th><th>Email</th><th>Password</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        Brendan
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Stanton
                </td>
                <td>
                        brendanrocks@gmail.com
                    </td><td> FakePassword123 </td></tr>
            </tbody>
    </table>
    <h1>Here is a list of my favorite things:</h1>
        <ul><li>Food</li>
    <li>Bandwidth</li>
        <li>Coffee</li>
        <li>Beach
        </li>
    </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```
