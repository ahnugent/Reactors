# Activity: Registration Form

Now that we've learned about all of the different types of form tags, let's create a registration form using only HTML. When registering for any website, whether it's for an email account, a social media platform, or even this workshop, you are submitting a form! You will be using lots and lots of forms over the next few months to send data to your backend so let's get comfortable creating some forms.

Recreate all the html elements shown on the image above! As you haven't learned yet how to use css to make the form look nice, don't worry about how your registration form looks for now.

Your HTML should contain the following tags:

- `<input>` with these values in the "type" attribute:
  - text
  - password
  - date
  - radio
  - submit
- `<textarea>`
- `<select>`

Don't feel the need to memorize all of the different form tags and attributes today, there are simply too many to memorize. Memorize where you can find the reference information for HTML tags. A great resource is [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp), a long standing web development reference online.

> **NOTE:** Remember to validate your code before submitting it. HTML validation services such as the free [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) Service are useful debuggers that help you identify rendering errors.

## What you learned

In this activity, you learned how to create a simple web form. You also learned how to implement some tags that you learned in previous sessions. Remember that it’s more important to know where to find information about HTML tags and forms rather than trying to memorize things. And lastly, don’t forget to use the validation tool. In the next section, we will begin examining  CSS selectors, styling, and display properties.
