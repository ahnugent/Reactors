# CSS Selectors

A selector is used to identify what items to modify. You can use selectors to identify an individual element, all elements of a particular type, elements with certain attributes or groupings, or even identify items based on their location in a page.

## Declaration block

A declaration block is a list of declarations contained within braces. Each individual declaration consists of a property, a colon (":"), and a value. If a block has multiple declarations, they must be separated by a semi-colon(";").

## Selecting elements

To select all elements of a particular type, such as `a`, `strong` or `div`, you simply use the name of the element. If you wanted to make all `p` elements blue, you could use the following:

``` css
p{
  color: blue;
}
```

## Selecting an individual element by id

HTML allows you to add IDs to elements. While we mostly focused on this behavior for [links](../2_HTML/common_body_tags.md#anchors) and [forms](../2_HTML/forms.md), you can add an ID to any element to identify it for use with CSS (or with JavaScript). We could identify an item with an ID of **heading** by using its name with a `#` in front.

``` css
#heading{
  font-size: 36px;
}
```

## Classes

You may wish to group items of a certain type together to ensure they're all displayed the same way. For example, you might want to bold links in a navigation pane, or ensure certain `h3` elements are blue. By using a `class` attribute you can group these items together, regardless of where they appear on a page. If you wish to add multiple classes to an item, you simply add spaces between the class names. So if we wanted a `div` to use both the `navigation` and `banner` class, we could use the following:

``` html
<div class="navigation banner">Hello, world!</div>
```

We can then create CSS to apply to classes by prepending the name of the class with a `.`.

``` css
.navigation {
  text-weight:bold;
}
.banner {
  color: blue;
}
```

> **NOTE**: If an element has multiple classes which match items in your stylesheet, all settings will be applied.

## Scoring

It doesn't take long to realize you could wind up in a situation where you could have a conflict in CSS settings. Consider the following:

``` html
<div class="header">Hello, world</div>
```

``` css
div{
  color: red;
}
.header{
  color: blue;
}
```

What color will **Hello, world** be? You could use a tool like [CodePen](https://codepen.io) to find out.

CSS breaks these types of conflicts by using a scoring system. At its root level, the following values are applied:

- element (1 point)
- .class (10 points)
- #id (100 points)

In a nutshell, the scoring is used to identify how specific of a reference to the item was made.

So in our example, the class entry of `div` would have a score of **1**, and the class of `header` **10**. Thus, the color would be red.

## Getting more specific

The three selectors listed above are the most common. However, there are [many more selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) offering you quite a bit of power for identifying specific items in a page.

However, even with those three we can still get more specific. Here's just a few possibilities

``` css
div{
  /* all div elements */
  color: red;
}
div.header{
  /* only div elements with a class of header */
  color: blue;
}
div a{
  /* only a elements inside a div */
  color: green;
}
div a.navigation{
  /* only a elements with a class of navigation inside a div */
  color: purple;
}
```

### Exercise

What color will the items in this HTML page be displayed?

``` html
<div>div</div>
<div class="header">div with header</div>
<div class="navigation">div with navigation</div>
<a>anchor</a>
<a class="navigation">anchor with navigation</a>
<div>
  <a class="navigation">anchor in div with navigation</a>
  <br />
  <a>anchor in div</a>
</div>
```

## What you learned

In this lesson, We learned how to style HTML elements by selecting them with their tag or by using a class or ID. Remember that IDs are used only once, And classes are designed to be used over and over again to style elements. Letâ€™s look at how to style HTML elements.
