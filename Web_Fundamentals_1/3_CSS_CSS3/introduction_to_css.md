# What is CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that web developers use to present and define the style in a document (like a webpage) written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is one of the foundational blocks of the web, along with JavaScript and HTML.

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

A stylesheet is used to define how content is presented, including layout, fonts, backgrounds, colors, and even transparency of a document. It's a list of rules. Each rule (or "rule-set") consists of one or more selectors (what items to modify) and a declaration block (how should they be modified).

## Getting started with CSS/CSS3

There are three ways of attaching CSS to a document:  inline, internal, and external. Inline and internal CSS are considered to be bad practices as they're not as reusable, and can cause inconsistent results. We will only use external stylesheets, linked from the HTML document using the `<head>` tag.

> **NOTE**: CSS uses a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches a particular element. In this scheme, priorities (or "weights")  cascade and are assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.

## What you learned

This is just the beginning of your education in CSS. Don’t forget that we’re going to be using external stylesheets. This way, you’ll learn how to connect CSS style sheets that you create or that are created by others. The next section will cover the most important part of CSS, the selector.
